# Prestige tier perks and allied-home access

Requirements REQ-179 to REQ-182. Decisions (Fain, 2026-11-09), from the Discord
"Prestige Suggestions" thread: practical rewards unlock permanently at prestige
tiers; guild-owned stalls get a cap of 1 with +1 from prestige; allied-home
access control is for every guild, not just prestiged ones.

## Tier perks (permanent, by current prestige tier)

| Tier (default) | Perk | Config |
|---|---|---|
| II | A second allied-home slot | `second_ally_home_tier` |
| III | One more guild-owned market stall (cap 1 becomes 2) | `extra_stall_tier` |

- The perk follows the guild's current prestige tier from the cached standing
  (30 s). A failed read means no perk, never a crash.
- The prestige confirmation lists the perk the new tier starts. The second
  allied home joins that list when it ships.
- Other plugins read the stall bonus from the public `GuildPrestigePerkLookup`
  service (Bukkit ServicesManager).

## Delivery

1. LumaGuilds `feature/prestige-tier-perks`: config, Quick Travel (REQ-179),
   stall bonus API (REQ-181 LumaGuilds side), confirmation lines.
2. EnthusiaMarket `feature/guild-stall-cap`: the cap (REQ-181, Market REQ-399).
3. LumaGuilds follow-up: second allied home (REQ-180) and allied-home access
   (REQ-182); both change how allied homes are stored.
- Quicker home teleports were first planned as a Prestige I perk. Fain moved
  them into Quick Travel instead (2026-11-09): see "Quick Travel" below.

## Quick Travel (every guild, bought as a level reward)

Quick Travel 1-5 (Lv10-50, multiplier 0.9 to 0.5) used to shorten only the
cooldown between `/g home` and `/g allyhome` uses. With the default 5-second
cooldown that saved at most 2.5 seconds, and the Java and Bedrock home menus
skipped the cooldown entirely. Now (REQ-179):

| Quick Travel | none | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Countdown | 5 s | 4 s | 4 s | 3 s | 3 s | 2 s |
| Cooldown | 100% | 90% | 80% | 70% | 60% | 50% |

- One cooldown for commands and menus, kept in `TeleportationService`.
- War-banner teleports keep the plain 5-second countdown and no cooldown.
- `guild.home_teleport_warmup_seconds` is still unused (the base countdown
  stays 5 s); the base cooldown is `guild.home_teleport_cooldown_seconds`.

## Guild stall cap (EnthusiaMarket)

- Guild-owned stalls are unlimited today (only solo players have limit groups).
- New: a guild may own at most `1 + bonus` stalls, where the bonus comes from
  LumaGuilds (1 at Prestige III by default). Market config
  `guild-stall-limit: 1` (`-1` keeps today's unlimited behaviour).
- Guilds already above the cap keep every stall they own; they just can't buy
  another until they are under it. Staff bypass still applies.

## Second allied home (Prestige II)

- Today a guild has one allied home (`allyHome`) with an allow-list of allied
  guilds. Prestige II adds a second slot; both share the same access rules.
- Set, move, remove and teleport work for both slots on Java and Bedrock; a
  guild that drops below tier II (disband only, since tiers never go down)
  keeps nothing extra.

## Allied-home access control (every guild)

The host guild decides who may use its allied homes, on one page (Java and
Bedrock):

1. **Which allies** (exists today): toggle each allied guild.
2. **Which of their ranks**: for each allowed ally, pick the ranks of that
   guild that may use it. Default: every rank that has "Use ally homes" in
   its own guild (today's behaviour).
3. **Blocked players**: add or remove individual players; a blocked player
   can never use the host's allied homes, whatever their rank.

Visitors still need "Use ally homes" in their own guild. Click-time and
countdown-end checks use the current rules (REQ-141 behaviour).

## Out of scope

- Changing who may set allied homes (still Manage home).
- Prestige perks beyond these three.

## As built (part 3)

- Storage: `ally_home_visitor_ranks`, `ally_home_blocked_players`,
  `ally_home_second_homes` (schema v51), loaded into memory at start and written
  through. Disband removes a guild's rows.
- Commands: `/g setallyhome [2]`, `/g removeallyhome [2]` (removing works even
  without the perk), `/g allyhome <guild> [2]`. The home menu lists a second
  home as "<guild> #2".
- Access page (Java): allies in rows 1-2 (left-click allow/deny, right-click
  their page), blocked players in row 3 (click to unblock). Each ally's page:
  their ranks (click to allow/deny, "Allow every rank" resets) and their
  members (click to block/unblock).
- Access page (Bedrock): one button per ally opens a form with the ally toggle,
  rank toggles and member block toggles; "Blocked players" lists blocks to untick.
- Rank picks and blocks apply to every visitor, the ally's owner included; the
  visitor still needs Use ally homes in their own guild. The check runs again
  when the countdown ends.

## Outbound picks per ally (REQ-183, Fain 2026-11-09)

"I might want members to have access to a certain ally home but not another."
On each ally's page the guild also picks which of its OWN ranks may use that
ally's homes. No pick: the rank's Use ally homes permission decides (as
before). The owner always keeps access. Stored in `ally_home_outbound_ranks`.
