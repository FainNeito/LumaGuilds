# LumaGuilds — Requirements (SPEAR)

Scope: the 2026-08-09 unwired/incomplete-feature audit (`docs/audit/MASS-AUDIT-2026-06-08.md` is the earlier, separate June batch — not in scope). Audit doc: `lumaguilds-audit-2026-08-09.md` (repo root, Aug 9). Each finding becomes one EARS requirement; tasks are derived in `docs/tasks.md` and grouped into PRs.

Legend: **Ubiquitous.** / **Event-driven.** / **State-driven.** / **Unwanted.**

---

## Section A — Critical: permissions

### REQ-001
**Unwanted.** IF a player holds the declared `lumaguilds.bedrock.cache.stats` or `lumaguilds.bedrock.cache.clear` permission THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT deny them via the stale `lumalyte.*` prefix in `BedrockCacheStatsCommand`, AND the command SHALL authorize via the exact declared nodes `lumaguilds.bedrock.cache.stats` / `lumaguilds.bedrock.cache.clear` only.

> Audit C1: `interaction/commands/BedrockCacheStatsCommand.kt:21,55,74,80` checks `lumalyte.bedrock.cache.*`; `plugin.yml:255,258` declares `lumaguilds.bedrock.cache.*`. Align code and plugin.yml to the same prefix.

### REQ-002
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player executes one of the guild subcommands `join`, `list`, `lfg`, `decline`, `invites`, `leave`, `transfer`, `getvault`, `vault`, `help`, `ally`, `enemy`, `truce`, `neutral` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL authorize it via the corresponding `lumaguilds.guild.<sub>` node, declared with `default: true` both as a child of the `lumaguilds.guild.*` wildcard and as an individual plugin.yml node.

> Audit C2: `GuildCommand.kt:1283,1399,1439,1449,1477,1569,1652,1995,2108,2174,2201,2274,2342,2410` — nodes used but never declared; ACF defaults them to false and silently blocks execution.

### REQ-003
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL grant `lumaguilds.claim.partitions`, `lumaguilds.claim.trustlist`, `lumaguilds.claimmenu`, and `lumaguilds.claimoverride` to every holder of the `lumaguilds.command.*` wildcard, and SHALL keep each of the four nodes declared both individually (`default: op`) and as children of that wildcard.

> Audit C2 (wildcard gap): the audit claimed these four nodes were missing from the wildcard's children set — re-verified against code + plugin.yml: they ARE declared (plugin.yml:165,170,175,176 + individual blocks). REQ-003 now locks both declaration forms.

---

## Section B — High: dead config, dead services, dead UI

### REQ-004
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load the entire `vault:` config section (config.yml:165-299: bank_mode, physical_currency, compressable_blocks, and all other vault keys) into the config model and apply it at runtime.

> Audit H1: no `loadVaultConfig()` exists in `infrastructure/services/ConfigServiceBukkit.kt`; admin edits have zero effect.

### REQ-005
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load the `bedrock:` config section (config.yml:673-735: icon URLs, cache settings, menu toggles) and apply it, AND SHALL ship production-usable icon defaults instead of `https://via.placeholder.com/...`.

> Audit H2: no `loadBedrockConfig()`; shipped icon defaults are placeholder-hosted images.

### REQ-006
**Event-driven.** WHEN chat settings are loaded THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL consume `chat.default_channel_visibility` and `chat.colored_chat_enabled` in the chat pipeline.

> Audit H3 (chat): both keys parsed into MainConfig, never read by any service/listener.

### REQ-007
**State-driven.** WHILE a guild is in peaceful mode THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce `guild.peaceful_mode_claim_pvp_disabled` (no PVP inside its claims) and `guild.peaceful_mode_prevent_wars` (war declarations blocked).

> Audit H3 (guild): both flags parsed, never consumed. Also REQ-027 (M11) for the related opt-in field.

### REQ-008
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce the combat configuration — `anti_griefing_enabled`, `war_duration_hours`, `war_end_grace_period_minutes`, `max_simultaneous_wars`, `kill_experience`, `war_win_experience`, `war_lose_experience`, `kill_cooldown_minutes`, `same_player_kill_limit`.

> Audit H3 (combat): 9 knobs parsed, never consumed. No war cap/duration enforcement in `WarServiceBukkit`; no anti-grief listener.

### REQ-009
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce the bank configuration — interest accrual per `bank.interest_rate_percent` and `bank.interest_compound_period_hours`, `bank.max_bank_balance`, `bank.audit_log_retention_days`, `bank.suspicious_transaction_threshold`, and `bank.auto_lock_suspicious_accounts`.

**Event-driven.** WHEN a player withdraws through the guild bank menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL credit the player's personal Vault Economy account on the server thread without creating inventory items. Withdraw All SHALL resolve the current affordable amount including configured withdrawal fees. A rejected payout SHALL restore the guild debit including fees. A thrown payout with an unchanged, verified personal balance SHALL also restore the debit; an ambiguous provider outcome SHALL be logged for administrator reconciliation without issuing a speculative refund.

**Event-driven.** BEFORE an external withdrawal payout THE SYSTEM SHALL persist a pending payout journal and confirm the guild debit has been written to the database. Failed debit persistence SHALL prevent payment. Completion or a confirmed persisted refund SHALL resolve the journal. Unresolved payouts SHALL block further withdrawals for that guild across restarts, remain available despite routine audit retention, and display an administrator-review warning with the transaction ID in Java and Bedrock menus. Provider balance lookup failures before debit SHALL reject without moving funds.

> Audit H3 (bank): 6 knobs parsed, never consumed. No interest-accrual task exists in `BankServiceBukkit`.

### REQ-010
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens the guild bank automation menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL display persisted automation settings (not the hardcoded `interestRate=0.02` fakes), persist changes through the save action, and render the real next-run time and status.

> Audit H4: `GuildBankAutomationMenu.kt` — `loadAutomationSettings()` returns fakes, save is a no-op message, next-run = now+1h, "Status: Healthy" hardcoded, 4 "coming soon" buttons (294, 319, 336, 353).

### REQ-011
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens the guild bank budget menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL display the guild's real persisted budget (`monthly`/`weekly`/`daily`) and persist changes through the save action.

> Audit H5: `GuildBankBudgetMenu.kt` — hardcoded `monthly=10000/weekly=2500/daily=500`, no save, 3 "coming soon" buttons (222, 239, 256).

### REQ-012
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens the guild bank transaction history menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL render the guild's actual transactions and make the search, type, member, and date filters functional.

> Audit H6: `GuildBankTransactionHistoryMenu.kt` — transaction items never added ("when API resolved"), filters are "coming soon" no-ops (219, 265, 443, 451, 459).

### REQ-013
**Event-driven.** WHEN the statistics menu requests a map render THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL produce real rendered maps for overview, trend, comparison, and proportion views, AND SHALL run the declared TTL cache cleanup.

> Audit H7: `MapRendererServiceBukkit.kt` — all 4 render methods return blank maps, renderer services commented out, `isAvailable()` hardcodes true, cache cleanup never scheduled.

### REQ-014
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL implement `CombatServiceBukkit.getPlayerGuilds()` and `getRelationType()` against the guild/relation domain instead of returning `emptySet()` and hardcoded `NEUTRAL`.

> Audit H8: `CombatServiceBukkit.kt:119-129` — inert placeholders; any combat/relation logic sees nothing.

### REQ-015
WHEN a guild withdrawal is offered THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL preview the calculated fee and total guild deduction; WHEN it succeeds THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL report the amount delivered, destination, actual charged fee and total deduction.

**Event-driven.** WHEN a player places a guild vault THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the placement against claims whenever claims are enabled.

> Audit H9: `GuildVaultServiceBukkit.kt:273-276` — `// TODO: Add claim validation when claims are enabled`; vaults place anywhere.

### REQ-016
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL render guild, bank, war, and admin messages exclusively from MiniMessage locale values, SHALL contain no legacy `§` or `&` formatting in locale resources, SHALL use Adventure `Component` output wherever the destination API supports it, and SHALL leave no lang keys unreferenced. THE SYSTEM SHALL apply opaque black text shadow to Component-capable output. THE SYSTEM SHALL render translated menu titles, item names, and item lore in small caps while preserving digits, punctuation, glyphs, and dynamically supplied proper names in their original spelling; chat text SHALL retain normal casing. String-only destinations such as Floodgate forms SHALL receive plain text and are not required to preserve shadows.

> Audit H10: ~200 guild/bank/war/progression/command/error/menu keys have zero `translate()` calls; only the claims UI + Bedrock forms use the lang system.
> Decision flag: audit offers "migrate commands to lang OR delete dead keys". Approved direction (finish features): migrate; delete nothing.

---

## Section C — Medium

### REQ-017
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin starts THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL either register `ShopIntegrationService` in DI with real consumers or remove it.

> Audit M1: dead class, never registered in DI, no consumers.
> Decision flag: default = remove (no consumers); flip to wire if a shop integration is planned.

### REQ-018
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load `brewingXp` (default 3) from config so operators can tune it.

> Audit M2: `MainConfig.kt:398` — field exists, no yml key/loader.

### REQ-019
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load `modeSwitchingEnabled` (default true) from config so it can be disabled.

> Audit M3: `MainConfig.kt:111` — field exists, no loader.

### REQ-020
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load `nameFilter` / `NameFilterConfig` (50+ regex patterns) from config.

> Audit M4: `MainConfig.kt:107` — field exists, no loader.

### REQ-021
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load `guild.banner_copy_physical_cost` (config.yml:143) and apply it to banner-copy operations.

> Audit M5: `loadGuildConfig()` never reads the key.

### REQ-022
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL apply the `ui.*.enchanted` menu-item setting so configured items render with the enchantment glow.

> Audit M6: `MenuItemConfig.kt:338` parses it; menu builders never apply it.

### REQ-023
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT ship the CSV export feature: `DiscordCsvService`, `FileExportManager`, `CsvExportService`, the `/bellclaims download|exports|cancel` commands, the bank-history / member-contributions menu export buttons, the `EXPORT_BANK_DATA` rank permission, and the `discord_webhook_url` / `discord_csv_delivery` config keys SHALL be removed.

> Decision flag (2026-08-10): Badger chose full removal over gating delivery on `discord_csv_delivery`. Removal also eliminates the audit M-finding (hardcoded `i.imgur.com/placeholder.png` avatar in `DiscordCsvService.kt:255`) and the dead `temp_exports` book-download path in `LumaGuildsCommand`.

### REQ-024
**Event-driven.** WHEN a war is declared THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL run the accept/decline declaration flow instead of auto-accepting immediately.

> Audit M8: `WarServiceBukkit.kt:80` — `TODO`; wars auto-accept.

### REQ-025
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL resolve Nexo emoji glyphs through the public API without reflection into FontManager.

> Audit M9: `NexoEmojiService.kt:198` — reflection hack, TODO to use API directly.
> Decision flag: if Nexo has no public API for glyph resolution, keep the reflection isolated behind the service interface and document why.

### REQ-026
**Event-driven.** WHEN the plugin loads THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load `combat.war_farming_cooldown_hours` (config.yml:408) and enforce it.

> Audit M10: key never loaded; always 1h default.

### REQ-027
**Event-driven.** WHEN peaceful mode is toggled THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL load and consume `peacefulGuildPvpOptIn` per guild.

> Audit M11: dead field in GuildConfig, never loaded nor consumed. Related to REQ-007.

### REQ-028
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT ship a Discord CSV avatar URL configuration.

> **SUPERSEDED by REQ-023** (2026-08-10): the entire CSV export feature — including `DiscordCsvService` and its hardcoded avatar — was removed. This requirement is obsolete; retained only as an audit trail (originally Audit M12: `DiscordCsvService.kt:255` hardcoded `https://i.imgur.com/placeholder.png`).

### REQ-029
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL ship `parties_enabled` in the shipped `config.yml` defaults.

> Audit M13: feature reads with default true but the key is absent from the defaults file, so it can't be disabled from defaults.

---

## Section D — Low: player-facing "coming soon" stubs

### REQ-030
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens the disband, leave, rank-list, or promotion confirmation menus THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL run the real operation instead of sending "coming soon!" and navigating back.

> Audit: `GuildDisbandConfirmationMenu.kt:17`, `GuildLeaveConfirmationMenu.kt:17`, `GuildRankListMenu.kt:12`, `GuildPromotionMenu.kt:17` — whole Java menus are stubs (Bedrock equivalents exist).

### REQ-031
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens the bank security menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL implement the dual-auth threshold setting instead of showing "coming soon".

> Audit: bank security ×1 (dual-auth threshold) click handler.

### REQ-032
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens a statistics detail view THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL render the 14 currently-stubbed drill-downs (kill stats, contributions, etc.) in addition to the implemented charts.

> Audit: 14/17 statistics detail views stubbed; charts implemented.

### REQ-033
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens war management THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL implement the 7 stub buttons (details, list, incoming, outgoing, stats, history, detailed).

> Audit: 7 war-management buttons are "coming soon" no-ops.

### REQ-034
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens party management THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL implement the 5 stub buttons (details, list, send request, create, access settings).

> Audit: 5 party buttons are "coming soon" no-ops.

### REQ-035
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens rank creation or rank edit THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL implement permission-category selection (RankCreationMenu:388) and rank reset (RankEditMenu:385).

> Audit: both handlers stubbed.

### REQ-036
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player interacts with guild settings, relations, or statistics menus THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL implement the remaining stub items: settings name-edit lore (GuildSettingsMenu.kt:77), enemies list (EnemiesListMenu.kt:232), peace agreement (PeaceAgreementMenu.kt:375,379), bank statistics tax system (GuildBankStatisticsMenu.kt:410,417), and statistics online tracking (GuildStatisticsMenu.kt:158).

> Audit: misc menu stubs; tax system text says "coming in a future update".

### REQ-037
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL ship no `.coming.soon` lang keys in the Bedrock forms properties.

> Audit: 11 keys in `lang/bedrock/forms.properties` (bank automation/budget/security, claim player/wide permissions, claim edit tool, party management ×2, war detailed stats, relation details, member list invite).

### REQ-038
**Event-driven.** WHEN a Bedrock player opens the bank budget, bank automation, bank security, claim player-permissions, claim wide-permissions, or edit-tool forms THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL present functional forms instead of read-only "coming soon" info forms.

> Audit: `BedrockGuildBankBudgetMenu`, `BedrockGuildBankAutomationMenu`, `BedrockGuildBankSecurityMenu`, `BedrockClaimPlayerPermissionsMenu`, `BedrockClaimWidePermissionsMenu`, `BedrockEditToolMenu` — read-only placeholders.

### REQ-039
**Event-driven.** WHEN a war declaration's escrow is withdrawn THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL complete the withdraw in the war service.

> Audit: `GuildWarDeclarationMenu.kt:527` — "will be implemented in the war service" (never).

### REQ-040
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player selects "return to LFG" in the join-requirements menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL reopen the LFG menu instead of closing the inventory.

> Audit: `JoinRequirementsMenu.kt:157`.

### REQ-041
**Event-driven.** WHEN a Bedrock player opens a localized form THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL detect the Floodgate locale instead of always falling back to the Minecraft locale.

> Audit: `BedrockLocalizationServiceFloodgate.kt:52`.

### REQ-042
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL construct `BaseBedrockMenu` via DI rather than the service-locator hack.

> Audit: `BaseBedrockMenu.kt:576`.

### REQ-043
**Event-driven.** WHEN a Bedrock player opens the join-requirements flow THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL use the Bedrock flow rather than the Java menu fallback.

> Audit: `MenuFactory.kt:1065`.

### REQ-044
**Event-driven.** WHEN a Bedrock player toggles auto-deposit in the guild bank menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL persist and apply the real setting.

> Audit: `BedrockGuildBankMenu.kt:77,301` — toggle hardcoded false; no-op fakes success.

---

## Section E — Domain purity (deferred)

### REQ-045
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL keep the `domain/**` layer free of framework/server imports (`org.bukkit`, `org.koin`, `co.aikar`, `net.kyori`), decoupling the 20 domain files (38 imports — mostly `domain/events/*` extending `org.bukkit.event.Event`) from Bukkit so the `forbidden:` contract in `docs/implementation.md` becomes enforceable.

> Origin: CodeRabbit PR #89 comment on `docs/implementation.md:21` — `forbidden: []` is not consumed, and Konsist's `dependsOnNothing()` only checks declared layers, so domain→org.bukkit imports pass the guard. Deferred to PR-10 (LG-1001); when merged, LayerRulesTest gains an external-package assertion and the forbidden list is populated.
---

## Section F — Operator backlog (Aug 11, Fain)

> Product backlog promoted to SPEAR requirements. Origin: operator notes (Fain),
> parts 1+2 — see git history on `docs/fain-backlog`. Items are actionable but
> not yet scheduled; PR grouping lives in `docs/tasks.md` (PR-11..PR-15).

### REQ-046
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player runs `/g balance` or `/g baltop` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL return correct balances/leaderboard data, AND `/g balance` SHALL tab-complete all guild names on the server.

### REQ-047
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild has set an emoji THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL allow clearing/removing it (currently impossible once set).

### REQ-048
**Conditional.** GIVEN an operator config entry mapping a guild name (string) to an emoji permission, WHEN that guild exists THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL grant all its members the configured Nexo permission (chat + guild-emoji usage); WHEN the mapping is removed, the guild is renamed/disbanded, or a member leaves THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL revoke the permission; WHEN an operator changes a mapping from permission A to permission B THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL revoke A and grant B (configuration-value replacement) so no guild-scoped Nexo permission outlives its grant.

### REQ-049
**State-driven.** THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain guild run progression from level 1 through level 100. Reaching target level `L` from `L - 1` SHALL require `floor(500 * L^1.15 + L * 150)` XP, totaling 5,446,893 cumulative XP to reach level 100 from level 1. Current-run XP and achieved level SHALL NOT decrease through ordinary play, war results, chapter rollover, or seasonal-rating reset; they MAY reset only through the explicitly confirmed, atomic prestige transition in REQ-093. XP SHALL accrue only from configured explicit activity sources and shared weekly guild quests. Every repeatable configured source pool SHALL have one fixed guild-wide period cap; there SHALL be no per-player cap and no combined daily guild cap. A pool reaching its cap SHALL NOT prevent another pool from awarding XP. Weekly guild quest rewards and their completion bonus SHALL remain outside all daily source caps.

### REQ-050
**Documented.** THE SYSTEM SHALL ship a complete level 1–100 reward tier list for each progression run. Every level SHALL provide an automatic visible benefit or level-up event; ordinary non-checkpoint levels SHALL advance the guild-bank capacity track, each level divisible by 5 SHALL unlock a raw-gold-purchasable numeric perk, and each level divisible by 10 SHALL unlock a raw-gold-purchasable major perk. The tier list SHALL state each perk's price, effect, persistence across prestige, and prestige-selection eligibility. Guild membership capacity SHALL be a fixed configurable limit (default 50) independent of level and prestige. Displayed levels 101–200 SHALL represent seasonal Elo rank only and SHALL NOT be treated as XP levels or grant progression rewards unless a later requirement explicitly defines a seasonal reward.

### REQ-051
**Conditional.** GIVEN two guilds are both current-run level 100 and complete a rated guild war, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL update each guild's seasonal Elo using true opponent-weighted Elo with configurable `k_factor` (default 40), starting and floor rating 1000, and expected score `1 / (1 + 10^((opponentRating - guildRating) / 400))`. A guild pair SHALL produce at most one fully rated result during the configured rematch window (default 7 days). Seasonal Elo SHALL map monotonically to displayed levels 101–200, with the default upper display threshold at 1600 Elo and ratings above that threshold remaining level 200. Prestige SHALL NOT reset seasonal Elo or rated-pair history; a prestiged guild becomes ineligible for new rated results until it reaches current-run level 100 again.

### REQ-052
**Event-driven.** WHEN an operator enables an "increased XP" period (e.g. double-XP weekend) THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL multiply applicable current-run XP awards before source-cap reservation while leaving every configured source cap fixed; the accepted award SHALL be limited to the source's remaining allowance.

### REQ-053
**Event-driven.** WHEN a rated guild war resolves THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL add or remove seasonal Elo according to REQ-051 without changing current-run XP or current-run level. Unrated wars and pre-level-100 wars SHALL NOT change seasonal Elo.

### REQ-054
**Conditional.** GIVEN raw-gold economy, THE SYSTEM SHALL require raw gold to create a guild and to activate each guild home, with costs scaling higher as more homes are unlocked. Cost model (contract): home #1..N costs `baseCost * scale^(n-1)`. The level 1–100 reward table MAY grant home capacity only where it explicitly says so. Purchased home capacity and activated home locations SHALL be permanent guild assets and SHALL NOT be revoked by prestige, seasonal-rating changes, or chapter rollover. Prestige SHALL grant exactly one additional permanent home-capacity unit per successful transition, subject to the configured lifetime prestige maximum.

### REQ-055
**State-driven.** THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce a 15-day guild-creation cooldown for players who create and then delete a guild within 7 days of creation (contract: `create_then_delete_window_days = 7`, `creation_cooldown_days = 15`, both operator-configurable). Deleting a guild older than the window does not start a cooldown. The cooldown starts at deletion time and blocks that player from creating a new guild until it expires.

### REQ-056
**Documented.** THE SYSTEM SHALL treat the prior level-200, unbounded-prestige proposal as superseded. Prestige SHALL use the bounded level-100 contract in REQ-093, SHALL reset only current-run level/XP and non-permanent purchased perks, and SHALL NOT reset seasonal Elo, source-cap usage, weekly-quest state, guild membership, ranks, relations, vault contents, canonical guild gold, activated homes, permanent home capacity, or previously selected permanent prestige perks.

### REQ-057
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild war is active THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL accurately track player kills and make them actually impact gameplay (war system overhaul; residual gaps after PR-4). Measurable contract: each war carries a kill counter per guild that (a) increments only on kills of opposing-guild members during the active war, (b) resets when the war ends, (c) is persisted so restarts do not lose it, and (d) drives war resolution — a guild whose counter reaches `combat.war_kill_win_target` (config, default 25) wins the war; the counter is also surfaced in `/g info` and war menus so its gameplay impact is observable.

### REQ-058
**Conditional.** GIVEN a secret server-side predicate is met THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger a massive, server-wide World War involving all guilds. Contract: (a) the predicate is defined in config as an operator-tunable expression with a documented default (initial default: a single guild reaches level 150 or total server guild level sum exceeds a configured threshold); (b) the predicate is evaluated on a fixed interval (config: `world_war.evaluation_interval_minutes`, default 5) and at guild-level-up; (c) the trigger is idempotent — it fires at most once per cooldown period (config: `world_war.cooldown_days`, default 30) and never re-fires while a World War is active; (d) a config/test override flag (`world_war.debug_force`) exists so the trigger can be exercised deterministically in tests.

### REQ-059
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild member places a war banner THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL (a) create a tactical teleport point for guild members bypassing teleport requests/guild-home slots, (b) make it destructible by any player, (c) last 15 minutes, (d) cost raw gold, (e) enforce one active banner per guild + placement cooldown, (f) require a specific guild rank permission, AND (g) broadcast `[Guild Name] has placed down a war banner.`

### REQ-060
**Event-driven.** WHEN war is declared on a guild THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL (a) show a prominent in-game alert to online members, AND (b) persist an unread declaration notice per guild member; WHEN a member who was offline at declaration time logs in THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL replay the pending notice and mark it read/acknowledged; WHEN a war ends THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL broadcast victory/loss messages server-wide.

### REQ-061
**Conditional.** GIVEN configurable war win conditions, THE SYSTEM SHALL support (a) required unique opposing-player kill counts (dupes excluded), (b) a ransom fee to surrender/end the war, (c) a "Champion" death-duel mode deciding the outcome, AND (d) XP boost/deduction for winner/loser (high-stakes).

### REQ-062
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild member logs into the server THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL notify the guild in-game.

### REQ-063
**State-driven.** THE SYSTEM SHALL display each member's current guild rank next to their name in guild chat (restoring the legacy feature).

### REQ-064
**Conditional.** GIVEN guild leadership, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a dedicated private chat channel for guild admins/leadership only.

### REQ-065
**Conditional.** GIVEN RoseChat feasibility, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL let guilds create and name custom chat channels for their own organizational structure.

### REQ-066
**Event-driven.** WHEN a member invites a player to the guild THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL record it, AND the Guild Statistics UI node SHALL display an internal invitation leaderboard (most invites per member).

### REQ-067
**State-driven.** THE SYSTEM SHALL keep the physical banners at server spawn updated to reflect current top guilds by Guild Level Leaderboard placement.

### REQ-068
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player opens the guild list GUI THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL list all server guilds with sort options: All-Time Active, Weekly Active (weighted by unique PvP kills), Guild Level (low→high), and Creation Date (old→new). Retrieval contract: paging is bounded at the service boundary — the lookup action accepts `(page, pageSize, sortKey, ascending)` and returns one page plus a total count, never a full `List` sliced in the GUI (the existing `GuildLookup.getAllGuilds()` unbounded path is NOT used); page size defaults to `guild_list.page_size` (default 18); navigation uses prev/next page buttons; sorting is deterministic — ties break by guild name (case-insensitive), then creation date, so page boundaries are stable across refreshes.

### REQ-069
**Conditional.** GIVEN the guild list GUI, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL display each guild's physical banner, defaulting to a plain white banner when none is set.

### REQ-070
**Event-driven.** WHEN a player clicks the Enemy/Ally sections of `/g info` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL expand to the full guild list (currently only top 3, no way to view the rest).

### REQ-071
**Conditional.** GIVEN a guild reaches a Discord-role level perk, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL create/link a Discord role that dynamically grants/removes itself as players join/leave the guild in-game.

### REQ-072
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild edits its description THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL allow embedding a Discord invite link for recruitment.

### REQ-073
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild is disbanded THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL broadcast a server-wide announcement.

### REQ-074
**State-driven.** WHILE weekly guild quests are enabled THE SYSTEM SHALL persist one shared weekly quest set for all guilds, generate it once per configured reset period, preserve it across restarts, catch up a missed reset on startup, and track progress independently per guild.

### REQ-075
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL represent a weekly quest as `[action] [amount] [target] [optional condition]`, generate only typed trackable combinations, reject incompatible, impossible, redundant, duplicate, or amount-invalid rolls with structured reasons, and use a bounded deterministic fallback when random generation exhausts its retry limit. Target location metadata SHALL validate only explicit location conditions and SHALL NOT create hidden location requirements.

### REQ-076
**Event-driven.** WHEN qualifying guild-member activity occurs THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL increment every matching active quest for that member's guild, retain progress beyond the milestone for leaderboard ranking, reject cancelled/creative/spectator activity, and prevent player-placed blocks from satisfying `NATURAL_ONLY` break quests while allowing player-grown crops under an `ANY` provenance policy.

### REQ-077
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild reaches a milestone THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL allow that guild to claim its configured Guild EXP and item rewards once during the active week; WHEN all milestone quests are claimed before reset THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL award the configured full-set Guild EXP bonus once; WHEN reset occurs THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL pay configured leaderboard Guild EXP positions before clearing progress. All reward paths SHALL be idempotent.

### REQ-078
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild member opens the main guild menu THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL provide access to a localized six-row weekly quest menu showing the shared quests, that guild's progress, claim status, rewards, leaderboard rank where enabled, full-set bonus state, pagination, and time remaining until reset.

### REQ-079
**Optional feature.** WHERE PlaceholderAPI is installed THE SYSTEM SHALL expose read-only timer, quest-definition, guild-progress, completion, reward, and weekly-bonus placeholders with documented safe fallbacks for missing players, guilds, quests, and active weeks; placeholder evaluation SHALL NOT generate, reset, claim, reward, or otherwise mutate quest state.

### REQ-087
**Event-driven.** WHEN a guild member opens the main Guild Dashboard THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL show a Statistics navigation item in the bottom-right slot directly below Economy, and activating it SHALL open the guild statistics menu.

### REQ-088
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL render every Java inventory-menu item name and lore component with italic decoration explicitly disabled at every component depth while preserving colors and all other intentional text decorations.

### REQ-089
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL validate each current-run XP event before cap accounting. Creative/spectator actions, cancelled events, suspicious or AFK input identified by the EnthusiaPlaytime integration, and player-placed blocks submitted as natural mining SHALL award zero XP and consume zero cap. Source definitions, award values, caps, and cap periods SHALL be operator-configurable for any supported vanilla material or entity while shipping the balanced defaults in the Chapter 2 progression design.

### REQ-090
**Event-driven.** WHEN the configured server-wide chapter end time arrives (default chapter duration three months) THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL process rollover through persisted idempotent states `SCHEDULED`, `FROZEN`, `BACKED_UP`, `ARCHIVED`, `RESET`, `PRUNED`, and `COMPLETE`, and SHALL expose safe read-only chapter-name and time-remaining placeholders. Rollover SHALL freeze rated changes, verify a restorable pre-reset database backup, archive final standings and chapter metadata, reset eligible guild seasonal Elo to 1000, prune only configured seasonal/transient data, and preserve guild identity, membership, ranks, canonical guild gold, vault contents, activated homes, permanent home capacity, prestige count, permanent prestige perks, current-run XP/level, quest history required for audit, and other non-seasonal state. Operators SHALL have status, postpone, retry, and explicitly confirmed force controls.

### REQ-091
**State-driven.** WHEN upgrading the production installation from Chapter 1 to the Chapter 2 progression model THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL archive the complete Chapter 1 standings, reset every guild's current-run level to 1 and current-run XP to 0, initialize seasonal Elo to 1000, and convert the number of canonical saved home locations into that guild's initial permanent home capacity (minimum one). Migration SHALL preserve guild identity, members, ranks, relations, canonical guild gold, vault contents, and every saved home location; SHALL NOT convert historical XP into Elo, prestige, perks, or economic value; and SHALL be dry-run capable, transactional, restart-safe, rollback-capable, and preceded by a verified backup.

### REQ-092
**Ubiquitous.** THE SYSTEM SHALL treat `vault_gold.balance` as the single canonical guild raw-gold-equivalent balance. Personal-account transfers through a Vault Economy provider, physical `RAW_GOLD`/compressed-block deposits, withdrawals, interest, admin credits, war costs, home activation, perk purchases, and prestige fees SHALL use one atomic guild-gold application service. Every credit route SHALL enforce the same effective capacity, transaction limits, permission, fee, suspicious-transaction, and audit rules before external currency/items are irreversibly removed. Ordinary vault-item slot capacity SHALL remain independent from guild-gold capacity. `bank_mode: BOTH` with physical currency enabled SHALL be valid and SHALL permit both personal-account and physical-item ingress into the same balance. A missing Vault Economy provider SHALL disable only personal-account transfers and SHALL NOT disable physical guild-gold or ordinary vault storage.

**Paid admission clarification (2026-09-13).** LFG join fees SHALL use this same journaled pipeline for either personal-account or physical-item payment. Admission eligibility and the default rank SHALL be validated before payment; confirmed admission replaces member deposit permission for this route. A completed join SHALL charge once and credit the canonical guild balance once. An uncertain payment, balance write, or membership completion SHALL remain pending for reconciliation and SHALL block another charge, including after restart. The caller SHALL NOT independently remove currency or issue speculative refunds.

**Durable war clarification (2026-09-14; REQ-039/092).** Declarations, war identity/status, statistics, wager amounts and settlement intent SHALL survive restart. Financial intent SHALL be recorded before a charge or refund. A completed leg SHALL not be repeated after a crash or failed state-marker write; an uncertain leg SHALL prevent speculative compensation and require reconciliation. Acceptance SHALL not publish an active paid war until funding is confirmed. A chosen settlement outcome SHALL be immutable once settlement begins. Corrupt or unavailable persistence SHALL fail closed rather than expose an empty war registry. Stale writers SHALL not overwrite a newer persisted state.

### REQ-093
**Conditional.** WHILE prestige is enabled, GIVEN a guild is current-run level 100, is below the configured lifetime maximum (default 3), has selected a purchased prestige-eligible non-permanent perk, has no active/accepted/unresolved war or outgoing declaration, and can pay the configured tier fee (defaults 10,000/20,000/30,000 raw-gold units) while leaving a balance no greater than its calculated post-prestige capacity, WHEN an authorized leader explicitly confirms prestige THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL atomically deduct the fee, increment prestige count, grant one permanent home-capacity unit, mark the selected perk permanent, reset current-run level to 1 and XP to 0, and deactivate every other non-permanent purchased progression perk. Prestige SHALL preserve seasonal Elo and pair history, source-cap consumption, weekly quest progress/reward flags, guild identity, membership, ranks, relations, canonical guild gold remainder, vault contents, activated homes, permanent home capacity, and prior permanent perks. Failure or retry SHALL grant neither duplicate rewards nor duplicate charges. The shipped default SHALL be `prestige.enabled: false` until the operator enables the community-approved feature.

### REQ-094
**Event-driven.** WHEN an integrating plugin (EnthusiaHolidays) unlocks a guild cosmetic through the public `GuildCosmeticUnlocks` service THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL durably record that the guild owns the cosmetic `(type, key)` with its display name and source, idempotently, and SHALL report success for an already-owned cosmetic. Holiday GUI themes marked `requiresUnlock` SHALL be offered in the theme selector only as **locked** until the guild owns them, and `setGuiTheme` SHALL reject a locked theme regardless of caller. WHEN a cosmetic is revoked THE SYSTEM SHALL remove ownership idempotently and reset a guild currently using that theme to `NEUTRAL`. The API SHALL use JDK-only signatures, SHALL accept unknown keys (so a newer integration cannot wedge its sync), and SHALL return false only for a nonexistent guild or a persistence failure. Progression themes without `requiresUnlock` keep their existing behavior.
